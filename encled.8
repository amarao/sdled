.SH NAME
encled \- SCSI Enclosure indicators (SES LED) control
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B encled
[\fI\-\-help\fR] [\fIenclosure/slot|disk_name|serial_number|ALL\fR] [\fIlocate|fault|off|locate_off|fault_off\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
Encled uses information in sysfs from ses.ko module to enumerate and control
enclosure indication for disks.
.br
SES is SCSI Enclosure Services, specialized protocol between enclosure
(backplane) and HBA (controller). It allows to enable/disable indication
on hot-swap slots for disks.
.SH INDICATION TYPES
There is two types of indication: fault and locate. Third indication (activity)
is unavailable for control from host. If one indicator is enabled, other is
automatically disabled. Keywords used: 'fault', 'locate' and 'off'.
.SH ENUMERATION
Enclosure enumeration is based on /sys/class/enclosure, and slot number is
reconstructed from 'Slot' name of enclosure.
Usually it looks like this: 6:0:23:0/14, where:
6:0:23:0 is enclosure address, and '/14' is 14th slot.
Note: Enumeration in encled may differ from sas2ircu or labels on the actual
backplane. Don't rely on the slot numbers!

.SH DISK NAME
There are several ways to indicate a disk in encled:
.IP \[bu]
by using drive name (/dev/sdaz) or a partition name (/dev/sdaz2)
.IP \[bu]
by using slot number (6:0:24:0/20)
.IP \[bu]
by using disk or partition UUID (/dev/disk/by-uuid or /dev/disk/by-partuuid)
.IP \[bu]
by using serial number.
.IP \[bu]
by using the special word 'all' to control all slots
(command 'encled all off' clears all indications).
.SH EXAMPLES
\fIencled /dev/sda fault\fR - enable fault indication for /dev/sda
.br
\fIencled /dev/sdfa locate\fR - enable locate indication for /dev/sdfa
.br
\fIencled /dev/sdz off\fR - clear indication for /dev/sdz
.br
\fIencled /dev/sdg\fR - view status of indication for /dev/sdg
.br
\fIencled 3:0:23:0/1 fault\fR - enable fault indication for the Slot 1 in enclosure 3:0:23:0
.br
\fIencled 3:0:23:0/2 locate\fR - enable locate indication for the Slot 2 in enclosure 3:0:23:0
.br
\fIencled 3:0:23:0/3 off\fR - clear indication for the Slot 3 in enclosure 3:0:23:0
.br
\fIencled 3:0:23:0/4\fR - view status of indication for the Slot 4 in enclosure 3:0:23:0
.br
\fIencled all fault\fR - enable fault indication for all slots in all enclosures
.br
\fIencled\fR - view status of all slots in all enclosures.
.br
.br
Example of the output:
.br
ENCLOSURE/SLOT   DEV FAULT_LED   LOCATION_LED
.br
----------------------------------------------------
.br
6:0:23:0/1  sdd fault_off   locate_off
.br
6:0:23:0/2  sde fault_off   locate_off
.br

.SH NOTES
.IP \[bu]
Encled supports only enclosure based devices (SAS/SATA).
.IP \[bu]
Desktop SATA controllers (AHCI), and direct-attach disks in SCSI are not supported.
.IP \[bu]
The software has been tested with Supermicro and AIC backplanes with LSI chips.
.IP \[bu]
Older name for encled was sdled.
